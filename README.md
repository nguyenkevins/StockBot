## About
This is a project created during dubhacks/hackathon, which uses Discord.py API. Inspired by many stock trading platforms, we wanted to create an easier way for users to learn about the stock market, especially during these boring times of the COVID-19 epicdemic. This is a good time to invest and learn about stocks.

**Problem** - Bored during COVID-19 and this is a good time to learn about and invest in stocks. Build a learning platform via discord and web app (canvas + blueprint). 

Possible features: User-Friendly, fake money trading to gain experience... 

Audience: Teenagers/young adults who wants to learn about stocks through experience with fake money (HAS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH DISCORD)

## About
This is a project created during dubhacks/hackathon, which uses Discord.py API. Inspired by many stock trading platforms, we wanted to create an easier way for users to learn about the stock market, especially during these boring times of the COVID-19 epicdemic. This is a good time to invest and learn about stocks.

**Problem** - Bored during COVID-19 and this is a good time to learn about and invest in stocks. Build a learning platform via discord and web app (canvas + blueprint). 

**Audience** - Teenagers/young adults who wants to learn about stocks through experience with fake money (HAS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH DISCORD) 

We chose to use Discord.py as our tool because we want to use it as our first step approch to displaying data. We plan on moving to HTML5/Mobile App later in the future.

## Potential Feature
Our team's main focus is to prioritize simplicity and organization as much as possible using Discord commands.
- Buy/Sell stocks
- Display basic info about a stock
- Look at specific info about a stock
- Display detailed info about a stock

## Research
